# Monte Carlo Methods

## Racetrack
Uses Off-Policy Monte Carlo Control to train a deterministic target policy to drive around a bend in a discretized racetrack. Weighted importance sampling is used to generate state value estimates for the target policy using only observations generated with an Îµ-greedy behavior policy.
